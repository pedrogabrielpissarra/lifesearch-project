# Bibliography and Data Sources

This section documents the main data sources and scientific publications that were consulted and used as a basis for the development of the LifeSearch application and for obtaining exoplanet data.

## Exoplanet Catalogs and Databases

*   **[Habitable Worlds Catalog (HWC) - PHL](https://phl.upr.edu/hwc)**
    *   A catalog of potentially habitable exoplanets maintained by the Planetary Habitability Laboratory (PHL) at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. Frequently referenced in development for data and classifications. (This information was particularly relevant around May 15, 2025, as per our previous discussions).

*   **[NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/)**
    *   An online astronomical database and data service that collects and serves public data on exoplanets and their host stars. Primary data source for the LifeSearch application.

*   **[The Habitable Zone Gallery (HZGallery)](http://www.hzgallery.org/)**
    *   A website that provides information and visualizations about the habitable zones of stars with confirmed exoplanets. Used as a source for habitable zone parameters.

*   **[ESEP Exoplanet Catalog (Observatoire de Paris)](http://exoplanetes.esep.pro/index.php/home-fr/table-des-exoplanetes-fr)**
    *   An interactive catalog of exoplanets maintained by the Observatoire de Paris.

*   **[NASA Science - Exoplanet Catalog](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/exoplanet-catalog/)**
    *   NASA portal with information and a catalog of exoplanets for the public and researchers.

## Scientific Publications and Methodologies

*   **[A new representation of stellar habitable zones (Kopparapu et al., 2013, 2014) - Referenced in MNRAS Article](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/471/4/4628/4096396)**
    *   This Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS) article (Hill et al., 2017) likely references or uses habitable zone models such as those by Kopparapu et al. to catalog exoplanets and their habitable zones. The specific link points to "Catalogue of habitable zone exoplanets" by M. L. Hill, C. A. L. Bailer-Jones, J. L. Benson, D. S. P. Teixeira.

*   **[Standard Primary Habitability (SPH) - PHL](https://phl.upr.edu/projects/standard-primary-habitability-sph)**
    *   A metric developed by the Planetary Habitability Laboratory to quantify the habitability of an exoplanet based on primary conditions for life as we know it.
