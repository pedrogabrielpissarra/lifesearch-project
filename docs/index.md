# Welcome to the LifeSearch Documentation!

LifeSearch is a web application designed for the detailed analysis of exoplanet habitability. Our tool allows amateur astronomers, students, and researchers to explore and evaluate potential life-supporting conditions on planets beyond our solar system.

## What is LifeSearch?

LifeSearch aggregates data from multiple astronomical sources, calculates a variety of habitability metrics (such as ESI, SPH, PHI, and SEPHI), classifies exoplanets, and generates detailed reports to assist in the assessment of their environments. For a complete overview of the project, its objectives, and functionalities, please visit our [About](about.md) section.
